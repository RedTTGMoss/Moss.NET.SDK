# Moss.NET.SDK
A library that exposes all functions and data structures to build [moss](https://github.com/RedTTGMoss/moss-desktop) extensions more easily.
The sdk provides an idiomatic wrapper around the [host functions](https://redttg.gitbook.io/moss/extensions/host-functions).
You can find a full overview of all functionalities the sdk provides in the [wiki](https://github.com/RedTTGMoss/Moss.NET.SDK/wiki).

# Getting Started

1. Install .Net 8
2. Install the custom template with `dotnet new install Moss.Net.Sdk.Templates`
3. Create a new project with `dotnet new moss-plugin`

You can find also an example plugin that uses all functionalities of the sdk [here](https://github.com/RedTTGMoss/Moss.NET.SDK/tree/main/src/SamplePlugin).
